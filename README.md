# simple-php-ecommerce
This is a simple ecommerce web application using php. It uses MVC architecture framework which I learned from Brad Traversy.

Once downloaded, you need to rename htaccess from 'htaccess' to '.htaccess'. 
You can't change the filename using Windows' rename because there's no name and only extension. 
So you could use command-line or through text editor like vscode
